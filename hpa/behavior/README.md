## README

Before runnning this sample, install Metrics-Server. see [hpa/README.md](../README.md).

## Customize HPA Behavior

Customized HPA behavior works as follows.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start[Start]
    desired["Calculate Desired Replicas (15s interval)"]
    check[Check]
    scaleout[Scale Out]
    stabilization[1min Later]
    scalein["Scale In (20%)"]

    start --> desired
    desired-->check

    check--chrrent = desired-->desired
    check--chrrent < desired-->scaleout
    check--chrrent < desired-->stabilization

    scaleout---->desired
    stabilization--yes-->scalein
    stabilization--no-->check
    scalein-->check
```

## Deploy HPA

Run PHP Server with cli or yaml manifest.

yaml manifest.

```sh
kubens default
kubectl apply -f hpa/behavior/httpbin.yaml
kubectl apply -f hpa/behavior/httpbin-hpa.yaml
kubectl get hpa
```

## Try HPA with LoadTesting

Before start loadtesting, open a new shell and watch Server status.

```sh
kubectl get po -w
```

Open a new shell and watch HPA status.

```sh
kubectl get hpa -w
```

Open new shell and run LoadTest. This makes scale out httpbin pod.

```sh
$ kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --rm --image=alpine/bombardier:v1.2.5 --restart=Never -- -c 5 -d 210s http://envoy

If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

## HPA Result

httpbin requests.cpu is `200m` and HPA is set with CPU percent `60%`, therefore hpa will scale pod when cpu utilization reached 120m.

$ k get hpa -w
